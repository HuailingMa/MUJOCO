# MuJoCo Simulation Projects

This repository contains a collection of simulation projects developed using the MuJoCo physics engine. Each project explores different aspects of simulation, such as kinematics, dynamics, control, and interactive environments.

## Projects List

1. **Planar Two-Link Manipulator**
   \\Demonstrates forward kinematics for a simple two-link manipulator.

2. **Differential Drive Car**
   - Models and controls a differential drive car, showcasing its dynamic behavior.

3. **Projectile Motion with Drag**
   - Simulates the motion of a projectile under the influence of gravity and aerodynamic drag.

4. **Interactive Simulation**
   - Creates an interactive simulation environment for user-controlled experiments.

5. **Inverse Kinematics with Jacobian**
   - Solves inverse kinematics problems using the Jacobian matrix for a robotic arm.

6. **Servo Control**
    - Demonstrates various servo controls for a simple pendulum, including position, velocity, and torque servos.

7. **Finite State Machine Control**
   - Implements a finite state machine to control a pendulum's swing up and hold in a vertical position.

8. **2D Ball Rolling/Sliding**
   - Simulates the rolling and sliding motion of a ball in a 2D environment.

9. **Trajectory Tracking Control**
   - Generates and tracks a predefined trajectory for a manipulator.

10. **Control of Underactuated Systems(LQR)**
   - Utilizes Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) to control underactuated systems like the double pendulum.
